# ATM

Weâ€™ve given you the complete code for your ATM class. Feel free to experiment with these static variables and methods. In particular, you might want to create a few more ATMs in the main() method and see how the static variables change. You could also consider writing a depositMoney() method that works in the opposite way as withdrawMoney().
